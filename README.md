# Crystal Collector Game

### Here's how the app works:

There will be **four crystals** displayed as buttons on the page.

The player will be shown a **random number** at the start of the game.

When the player **clicks** on a **crystal**, it will add a specific amount of **points** to the player's **total score**.

The player wins **if their total score matches the random number** from the beginning of the game.
![Winner](assets\images\winner.JPG)

The player loses **if their score goes above the random number**.
![Loser](assets\images\loser.JPG)

The game **restarts** whenever the player wins or loses.
